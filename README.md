# Basic Tally Counter

Whilst doing inventory recently I wanted an easy way to count and save the stock levels of different items without having to do a tally chart. I figured something where I could just press a button to increase count would be a nice way to do this.
I've added the ability to save a total with a name to improve how useful it is.

# Potential Improvements

* change save total and show total from alert pop up boxes to something better
* maybe make add take up more space than subtract
* add way to clear saved totals
* add way to count in different steps than 1
* add way to count in user defined steps
